Setting up dual screens in Manjaro XFCE

So first off all it depends on what kind of graphics card you use on your computer.
This is just how to do it with the Nvidia graphics card. It's different for the other
graphic cards.

Firstly, run xrandr and check if your secondary display is connected. If it doesn't show up
that means that your most probably using nvidia and intel hybrid graphics and you can't add
displays when you do that.

So we'll have to fix that first.

First check if you have the right drivers insalled for nvidia:
Manjaro Settings Manager > Hardware Configuration > video-hybrid-intel-nvidia-440xx-prime
if you have that downloaded and running then you can install optimus-prime:
You can find a guide on how to set up optimus-prime here - 
https://forum.manjaro.org/t/guide-install-and-configure-optimus-manager-for-hybrid-gpu-setups-intel-nvidia/92196

Once you have that installed you can enable optimus-prime to use nvidia on boot by adding this config file:
default config: /usr/share/optimus-manager.conf (do not edit)
user config: /etc/optimus-manager/optimus-manager.conf

so add this in the user config file:
[optimus]
startup_mode=nvidia

That will make it so that you'll start with nvidia each time you start using your pc

Now to enable the display just run this command on startup:
$ xrandr --auto --output <your-monitor-name> --mode <your-monitor-resolution> --right-of <your-primary-monitor>

you can get your primary monitor and your secondary monitor by running the command:
$ xrandr

you get the resolution also there.
an example command of xrandr:
$ xrandr --auto --output HDMI-0 --primary --mode 1600x900 --left-of eDP-1-1

you can add the primary flag if you want to make your secondary display your main display.
