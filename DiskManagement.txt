In windows open the disk manager

- To install Linux:

Shrink one of the disks to make space for your linux system.
Then create a new volume and format it into Ext4 using a
3rd party application. Do this to prevent windows trying to access
the drive.

- To uninstall Linux:

- Format the partition using any application.
- Open CMD as admin and run the following commands

Diskpart
list vol
select vol {volume number}

assign letter=Z
exit
Z:
cd EFI
dir
rd {Name of Folder with Linux Disto name} /s

Diskpart
list vol
select vol {vol no.}
remove letter=Z
exit

# If you see the linux drive listed in file explorer then
diskpart and select the corresponding volume and remove the
letter assigned to it.
