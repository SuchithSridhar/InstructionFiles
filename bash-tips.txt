Bash scripting 

|| --> run if previous failed
&& --> run if previous succeed


if [ "$EDITOR" = "" ]; then
	EDITOR=nano
fi


if [ -z "$EDITOR" ]; then
	EDITOR=nano
if

[ -z "$EDITOR" ] && EDITOR=nano

[ -d "path/to/folder" ] && folder exists

# note - never do command || command && command 
# you wont get expected results as if the first command runs then
# the second commands does not run and the default exit code is 0

sooo always && && && || in scripts

if some_command; then
    echo command returned true
else
    echo command returned some error
fi

Or to turn that around use ! for negation

if ! some_command; then
    echo command returned some error
else
    echo command returned true
fi
