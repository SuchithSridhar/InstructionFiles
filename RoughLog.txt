Im trying out different types of terminals now, i have 4 of them downloaded and im just curious to see how different each of them are and which one i prefer.

Im also learing different commands related to linux to see where i can go with this and too see how i can use those commands in my everyday useage.

- Set the keyboard backlight to work using xset

- Customized the window managers:
	- window manager
	- window manager tweaks

- Installed Discord
- Installed notepadqq

got my settings and keybindings from my Windows VSCode
C:\User\LENOVO\AppData\Code\User - settings.json, keybindings.json
pasted it:
~/.config/Code/User

- tried pip install pygame
	- failed
	- pip install --user [package]
		- this worked for most other things but not
		for pygame

- import tkinter failed
	sudo pacmac -S tk
	fixed the issue
	
- pip install --user setuptools
- pip install --user wheel
- pip install --user --upgrade setuptools
- pip install --user --upgrade wheel
	
- pamac install python-pygame
- pamac install python-beautifulsoup4

- python -
import tkinter
import bs4
tkinter._test()


its been a while since i been using brave and honestly its fine. Im not gonna say its much better than any other browser but at the same time its not lower/worse than any other browser. I thing i prefer about this is the fact that this has built in ad blocker and trackers blocker and i have the ability to disable them very easily, which i thought was a granted untill i came across firefox.

Just changed the alias of 'ls' command in the ~/.bashrc file to
alias ls='ls -1 -h --color=auto --group-directories-first'


learn how to launch a program in terminal but as a seperate instance :
either: (firefox &)
or: firefox & disown firefox

checked for errors using:
sudo systemctl --failed

it said 0 units so im assuming that everything was ok.

I used the 'journal' to look for errors using the command:
sudo journalctl -p 3 -xb

and this was the output:

I asked reddit to see if i had to fix any of these errors and if so how i could do it.

- They weren't all that helpful but i did get some links that i can study from.

I tried building applications for AUR and it never worked and always too very long, I
asked what i could do about this problem and the community told me that i should use
something like flatpak and snap which are different package managers and they have
different repositories and blah blah.

I was learning about the different desktop environments and I had downloaded Gnome, KDE
and I've created a live USB with all of the following using an app called "Multibootusb"

I actually really like some of the thing that are there in both gnome and kde but... i
was not able to figure out exatly how to make things work.

now i just have edited my xfce and im looking up stuff and learning how to make it suit
for me.
