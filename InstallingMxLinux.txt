Ok so i wanted to install MxLinux since it uses apt instead of pacman like manjaro and every damn tutorial out there is based on apt.

So… I tried using the MultiBootUsb Feature and getting the distro there but that didn't work and I had to create a seperate file for this distro.

That point 1 for bad start.

Then I launched the installer and I went through the options, there you get to a place where you have to choose the bootloader… I don't know why it would let you CHOOSE something like that but then after a quick google search out of

Select boot method:
(tick)Install GRUB for MX Linux and Windows
Install on: mbr() pbr() esp(tick)
System boot disk:[Drop down]
- SYSTEM_DRV 260MB
- EFI 		 3	MB

I choose esp since the internet said it was the way to go and it was the default selected option. However… I didnt know about the System boot disk… I knew that the SYSTEM_DRV was a windows things and I didn't want this thing to touch it. I know that the other partition that was there was created by manjaro and i though that its better if i choose that. But once MX Linux was done installing it gave me an error that said:
"grub installion failed, use grub rescue menu to repair the installtion"

I have never been so glad to about a simple drop down choice.

That said i almost gave up on install Mx Linux and decided to go back and install manjaro again. But in the last moment, I had an idea.

I copied the entire SYSTEM_DRV to another partition in the gparted of the live version of Mx Linux and took photos of all its attributes (boot, hidden and esp). After this i was confident to hit that button to make it so that mx linux uses the SYSTEM_DRV partition. I swear this entire time there was sweat dripping down my butt so bad…

The last few percentages 95, 96, 97, … my assmy clenching so hard XD BUT IT WORKED !!!!

The explaination i give is like so:
While i was trying to uninstall manjaro once when i accidently broke it i went into this partition and removed some text reguarding the boot loader and i think thats whats happened here. Mx linux was just trying to add that there so that the system would see the mx linux boot.

Now… I need to change the system settings so that the computer directly boots into windows so that dad doesn't get mad at me so ima do that first.

Its the same changes as last time but i added one more change this time:

/etc/default/grub
-------------------
GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5

# Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)
#GRUB_TERMINAL=console
--------------------
were changed to
--------------------

GRUB_DEFAULT="Windows Boot Manager (on /dev/sda2)"
GRUB_TIMEOUT=1

# Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)
GRUB_TERMINAL=console

--------------------

and then ofc the command:
update-grub

I changed the background of the greeter by maually editing files:

etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf
changed
user-background = true

I donwloaded Franz and Rambox which are messaging controling
apps for linux, i got it for whatsapp.

Ran 2 commands form ubunty forms to fix Franz and Rambox which basically
owned and changed the attributed of a certain file.
sudo chown root:$USER /opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox
sudo chmod 4755 /opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox

to fix the problem:
FATAL:zygote_host_impl_linux.cc(138)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.

The errors were similar to this however it was not the same, i changed
/opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox with
/opt/Franz/chrome-sandbox

installed the applications:
Rambox
Discord
VSCode
Audacity
SimpleScreenRecorder
Kdenlive

I also got a bash script on stackoverflow for running apps
on startup and then moving them to a different workspace.
OnStartup.sh, the first line is:#!/bin/bash
It had a command wmctrl… which is the window manager control
and its quite insightful.

Set execute permission on your script:
chmod +x script-name-here.sh
To run your script, enter:
./script-name-here.sh
OR
sh script-name-here.sh
OR
bash script-name-here.sh
