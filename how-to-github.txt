-- How to use github --



Firstly install git:
	Windows: https://www.stanleyulili.com/git/how-to-install-git-bash-on-windows/
	Linux: (Comes built in)
	Mac: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git
	
Configure git (in git bash / mac terminal):
	$ git config --global user.name "YourGithubUserName"
	$ git config --global user.email "YouGithublinkedEmail"
	
	use your name and email
	
Clone (Download) the folder from github:
	$ git clone https://github.com/SuchithSridhar/COVIDHackers.git
	
	
	
	----- This is the end of the first time set up ----
	
Access a perticular branch to start code
	$ cd COVIDHackers
	(you can use <Tab> to autocomplete)
	
	$ git checkout TestBranch
	(The name of the branch depends on which project you have been assigned)
	
	$ git checkout -b AddingButtonFeature-Suchith
	(Here you are creating a new branch to add your feature)
	
	--- Now in your computer if you create files in this "COVIDHackers folder its only added to your branch" ---
	lets create a test file
	
	$ echo "Testing the git commands" > "testfile.txt"
	
	(Now this file has been added to your branch)
	(Once you done coding your things)
	
	$ git status
	(make sure you are on your branch, if not then do git checkout NameOfBranch)
	(Never do anything to master branch)
	$ git stash
	$ git pull
	$ git stash apply
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "description of the changes you made"
	$ git push --set-upstream origin AddingButtonFeature-Suchith
	
	(Once you are done with everything you want to add, inform me, i'll merege your feature with the main app)
	
IMPORTANT: Never do anything in master branch.
	
--- Lets try doing a test project --

I've created a branch called TestApp
so change to that branch then make your feature branch
then add a new file
add .
then commit the files
then push
and then inform me
