changed the bg of greeter in:
etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf
changed
user-background = true


downloaded Franz which is a messaging client but that didnt work too well and so im trying rambox.

installed the applications:
Rambox
Discord
VSCode
Audacity
SimpleScreenRecorder
Kdenlive

wrote a bash script to open terminal, brave and move it to their
correspoinding workspaces.

Ran 2 commands form ubunty forms to fix Franz and Rambox which basically
owned and changed the attributed of a certain file.
sudo chown root:$USER /opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox
sudo chmod 4755 /opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox

to fix the problem:
FATAL:zygote_host_impl_linux.cc(138)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that /opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.

The errors were similar to this however it was not the same, i changed
/opt/google/chrome/chrome-sandbox with
/opt/Franz/chrome-sandbox

changing greeter wallpaper:
/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf

If you want to change the theme lightdm uses, run  
sudo lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings
Which will provide a GUI for changing the appearance of the login screen.

slick-greeter
webkit2-greeter

apt install lightdm-slick-greeter

change the splash screen on boot:
https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-change-the-linux-splash-screen/
this is the grub screen backgrond.

I added a few aliases by using the mx settings app under which there was 
a bash control app.

apt install tree
- list all the dir and sub dir and files of a dir.

adding powerline:-
apt install powerline
apt install fonts-powerline

then added these lines into .bashrc:
if [ -f /usr/share/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh ]; then
source /usr/share/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh
fi

Taking screenshots instantly
This almost does what you want:
$ xfce4-screenshooter -f -s /path/to/save

You still have to hit the 'Save' button after the screen capture because
they weren't smart enough to allow for defining the file name, just its location.

Edit:
$ scrot /path/to/filename.jpg
works silently (also with .png extension). 'scrot' is in repositories.

I wanted my windows to open in the center of the screen instead of the top left corner and in
window manager tweaks > placement > center windows
was ticked but it still didn't open it in the center.
I googled it and found out that by changing the 
"minimum size of windows" to larger from small would center the
windows and I tried that and it WORKED!

I've had problems where windows and linux dont agree on the time and dad
found out about that but didn't realise its because of my linux system.
So it turns out that Windows uses local time on your computer where as
linux uses UTF-8 time and this causes the time to go out of sync.

To set the hardware clock to local time.

# hwclock --set --date="2019-04-06 11:30:00" --localtime
To set the hardware clock to UTC time.

# hwclock --set --date="2019-04-06 11:30:00"  --utc

Installed meld to compare files/ directories


Didnt do this but tried and failed, see Install java doc to see how to do ----
----------------------------------------------------
Installing the mullvad free and open source vpn

then installing java for java development
[username:~/] sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/javaFix add-apt-repository

: command not found error


The error is simple. The package add-apt-repository is not installed on your system.

But if you try to use sudo apt-get install add-apt-repository, it won’t work.

It’s because add-apt-repository command is under the package software-properties-common and you need to install this package in order to install add-apt-repository.

So, open a terminal and use this command:

sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

[username:~/] sudo apt-get update
[username:~/] sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
[username:~/] sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default

then install mysql:
> sudo apt-get install mysql-server
> sudo apt-get install mysql-workbench

uninstalled pip using apt purge and from the official website got 'get-pip.py'
this was to fix the problem that 'pip list --outdated' not working.

Added ~/.local/bin to PATH in the .bashrc file and the .xsessionrc file
the .bashrc file only updated the terminal PATH and the .xsessionrc file
was necessary to update the path of the rest of the computer.
