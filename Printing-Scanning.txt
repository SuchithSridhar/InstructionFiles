==== Printing on Linux ====

I have a samsung_m2020_series printer and since this is not an hp printer you
have to go to the samsung webiste and download the linux drivers for the device
I got the drivers from this link:
https://www.driversamsung.com/samsung-m2020-download-driver/

This downloads an archived file which when you unarchive you can navigate inside
to find an install script. All you have to do is run this install script and you're
done.

Once this is set up you need to have cups running in the background.
Cups by default is launched on port 631. So going to localhost:631 should show you
the cups web interface. Go through the process and add a printer there and select
the right drivers and etc.

Once the printer is set up you can directly ctrl-p from a pdf viewer or whatever and
it should print it for you.

CLI OPTIONS:

lp -P page-nums -o options=value -n num-of-copies
example:
lp -P 1-2,5-7,9 -o fit-to-page -n 2

lpstat -a
lpoptions
lpq
lpr

lpr - for printing with non default printers
lpr -P printer_name filename.txt

# set default printer with this command
lpoptions -d <Printer-Name>


==== Scanning on Linux ====

Since I have an hp scanner its easier for me to scan things since manjaro comes built-in
with hp-device drivers.

so I just run the commands:
hp-scan --mode=color

and that takes care of scanning for me

ps. if I want to scan multiple things:
for i in {1..6}; do hp-scan --mode=color; done;
That will run the scanner 6 times one after the other.

do run man hp-scan or hp-scan --help for more options
