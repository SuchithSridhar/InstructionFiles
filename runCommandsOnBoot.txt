First create a systemd service:

```
/etc/systemd/system/onBoot.service
[Unit]
Description=Set max charge of computer to 60

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/max-charge.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Once that is done you can create the script
which will be called by the ExecStart.

```
/usr/bin/max-charge.sh

#!/bin/sh
echo 60 | tee /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_end_threshold
```

Once that is done you can mark this file
as an executable and you're all set to go
