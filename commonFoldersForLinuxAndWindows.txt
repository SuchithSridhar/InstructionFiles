This is a solution to using 2 different operating systems but wanting to use the same set of folders

firstly this is how I've parted my drive which is 512GB

Windows OS - 120GB (NTFS)
Linux OS - 120GB (EXT4)
Suchi DRV - Rest of the space (NTFS) (For compatabitly with windows)

So now the idea is that both linux and windows use the same Suchi DRV partition to save all the data.
But that said I didn't want to manually move files into this partition so this is how to set is so that
your home folder in linux is based in this new partition.

Firstly you want to auto mount this partition on linux
so for that we need to edit a file "/etc/fstab"

Let's get info about our partition:
$ sudo blkid
/dev/nvme0n1p1: UUID="CC9B-1F3E" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat" PARTLABEL="EFI system partition" PARTUUID="0bdbfb7d-8280-4a52-908f-5dc610b77c4e"
/dev/nvme0n1p2: PARTLABEL="Microsoft reserved partition" PARTUUID="8c1df372-fa2d-4519-8be6-a9e52cbb5780"
/dev/nvme0n1p3: BLOCK_SIZE="512" UUID="6AEC9DB4EC9D7B51" TYPE="ntfs" PARTLABEL="Basic data partition" PARTUUID="76dc7d96-8824-4f9b-b4e7-7a25c86ae015"
/dev/nvme0n1p4: LABEL="Suchi" BLOCK_SIZE="512" UUID="8E56F13A56F1241D" TYPE="ntfs" PARTLABEL="Basic data partition" PARTUUID="1948375c-170f-4a20-ae4f-d99fd96cd4f3"
/dev/nvme0n1p5: BLOCK_SIZE="512" UUID="74FAD0BDFAD07CB4" TYPE="ntfs" PARTUUID="79d78f1d-5e3b-4744-95ba-04e2f63eddee"
/dev/nvme0n1p6: UUID="a22ca60f-d059-4fe5-bd78-589430cda2e0" BLOCK_SIZE="4096" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="177e0bb7-12f3-ac44-a3cd-7862c684eed6"

the import parts of this is the UUID

now let's create a place to mount our partition. Usually any mounting is done in the /mnt folder
so I'm going to create a folder to mount my partition there
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/Suchi

(fstab = file system table)
now let's edit /etc/fstab
you need to add a line in the end that looks like this:

UUID=8E56F13A56F1241D	/mnt/Suchi	ntfs	defaults	0	2

note that these are seperated by tabs.
its in this format:
UUID=<your uuid> <your mount point> <file system type> <options> <dump> <pass>

the options is set to default to signify that all users have permission to access this folder.
once that's done you've successfully mounted the partition onto your file system.

Now let's create links for your home directory.
(clear out you home directory since we'll be linking all the folders to the folders in the Suchi DRV)

so Suchi DRV looks like this:
Suchi DRV
├── Suchi
    ├── Documents
    ├── Downloads
    ├── Music
    ├── Pictures
    ├── Programming
    ├── Public
    └── Videos

and my home folder is empty
so i run this for loop:

for i in Documents Downloads Music Programming Public Videos
do
ln -s /mnt/Suchi/Suchi/$i $i
done

So what is basically does is create a symbolic link to the actually directories but for
all purposes they behave like real directories. You can cd into them you can do anything you want with them
and it updates the actual directory too.

So that solves our problem for linux. We can use linux download files from the browser and it will
be automatically updated in the Suchi DRV which uses NTFS.

Now if you want to use the same pictures and videos folders for windows to you just have to create the same
symbolic links in the windows to these folders and then you wont be able to tell the difference. But for my
case I just wanted to be able to access these files and folders from windows and I for the most part won't
create files in windows and even if I do I can access them in linux anyway so I'm not going to create
symbolic links for the folders in windows.
